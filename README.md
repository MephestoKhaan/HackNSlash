In order to use this you will need:

2 foam swords 
2 android-wear watches
2 android devices (paired to a watch)

Simply run the app in the phone and wear and pair the Ips (one as the server and other as the client). 
Then just hit one sword with the other one to sync the game and start playing!!
Each player has 5 lives, if you hit the other player in the body he loses 1 live and you get 1 second to start over with another round.
